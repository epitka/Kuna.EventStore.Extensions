# Kuna.EventSourcing

This is a no nonsense, lightweight library that provides everything you need to build event sourced solutions from scratch. It currently uses [EventStore db](https://www.eventstore.com/) as a backing store.

For a quick overview of some of the basic features of the library check out wiki [Quickstart](https://github.com/epitka/Kuna.EventSourcing/wiki/Quickstart)

Included is a sample application that shows most of the functionality.
